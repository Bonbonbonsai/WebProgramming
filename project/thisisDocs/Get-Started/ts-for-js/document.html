                <h1>TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers</h1>
                <p>
                    TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript. TypeScript offers all of JavaScript's features, and an additional 
                    layer on top of these: TypeScript's type system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, JavaScript provides language primitives like <b>string</b> and <b>number</b>, but it doesn't check that you've consistently 
                    assigned these. TypeScript does.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that 
                    it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This tutorial provides a brief overview of TypeScript, focusing on its type system.
                </p>

                <h2>Types by Inference</h2>
                <p>
                    TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases. For example in creating 
                    a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-1.png" alt="code-1">
                <p>
                    By understanding how JavaScript works, TypeScript can build a type-system that accepts JavaScript code but has types. This offers a type-system 
                    without needing to add extra characters to make types explicit in your code. That's how TypeScript knows 
                    that <b>>helloWorld</b> is a <b>string</b> in the above example.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may have written JavaScript in Visual Studio Code, and had editor auto-completion. Visual Studio Code uses TypeScript under 
                    the hood to make it easier to work with JavaScript.
                </p>

                <h2>Defining Types</h2>
                <p>
                    You can use a wide variety of design patterns in JavaScript. However, some design patterns make it difficult for types to be inferred automatically 
                    (for example, patterns that use dynamic programming). To cover these cases, TypeScript supports an extension of the JavaScript language, 
                    which offers places for you to tell TypeScript what the types should be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, to create an object with an inferred type which includes <b>name: string</b> and <b>id: number</b>, you can write:
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-2.png" alt="code-2">
                <p>
                    You can explicitly describe this object's shape using an <b>interface</b> declaration:
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-3.png" alt="code-3">
                <p>
                    You can then declare that a JavaScript object conforms to the shape of your new <b>interface</b> by using syntax like<b> : TypeName</b> after a variable declaration:
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-4.png" alt="code-4">
                <p>
                    If you provide an object that doesn't match the interface you have provided, TypeScript will warn you:
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-5.png" alt="code-5">
                <p>
                    Since JavaScript supports classes and object-oriented programming, so does TypeScript. You can use an interface declaration with classes:
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-6.png" alt="code-6">
                <p>
                    You can use interfaces to annotate parameters and return values to functions:
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-7.png" alt="code-7code-7">
                <p>
                    There is already a small set of primitive types available in JavaScript: <b>boolean</b>, <b>bigint</b>, <b>null</b>, <b>number</b>, <b>string</b>, <b>symbol</b>, 
                    and <b>undefined</b>, which you can use in an interface. TypeScript extends this list with a few more, such as any (allow anything), unknown 
                    (ensure someone using this type declares what the type is), never (it's not possible that this type could happen), and <b>void</b> (a function which 
                    returns <b>undefined</b> or has no return value).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You'll see that there are two syntaxes for building types: Interfaces and Types. You should prefer <b>interface</b>. Use <b>type</b> when you need specific features.
                </p>

                <h2>Composing Types</h2>
                <p>
                    With TypeScript, you can create complex types by combining simple ones. There are two popular ways to do so: with unions, and with generics.
                </p>

                <h3>Unions</h3>
                <p>
                    With a union, you can declare that a type could be one of many types. For example, you can describe a <b>boolean</b> type as being either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>:
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-8.png" alt="code-8">
                <p>
                    <i>Note:</i> If you hover over <b>MyBool</b> above, you’ll see that it is classed as <b>boolean</b>. That’s a property of the Structural Type System. More on this below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A popular use-case for union types is to describe the set of <b>string</b> or <b>number</b> literals that a value is allowed to be:
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-9.png" alt="code-9">
                <p>
                    Unions provide a way to handle different types too. For example, you may have a function that takes an <b>array</b> or a <b>string</b>:
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-10.png" alt="code-10">
                <p>
                    To learn the type of a variable, use <b>typeof</b>:
                </p>
                <div class="table">
                    <div id="1"><b>Type</b></div>
                    <div id="2"><b>Predicate</b></div>
                    <div id="3">string</div>
                    <div id="4">typeof s === "string"</div>
                    <div id="5">number</div>
                    <div id="6">typeof n === "number"</div>
                    <div id="7">boolean</div>
                    <div id="8">typeof b === "boolean"</div>
                    <div id="9">undefined</div>
                    <div id="10">typeof undefined === "undefined"</div>
                    <div id="11">function</div>
                    <div id="12">typeof f === "function"</div>
                    <div id="13">array</div>
                    <div id="14">Array.isArray(a)</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    For example, you can make a function return different values depending on whether it is passed a string or an array:
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-11.png" alt="code-11">

                <h3>Generics</h3>
                <p>
                    Generics provide variables to types. A common example is an array. An array without generics could contain anything. 
                    An array with generics can describe the values that the array contains.
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-12.png" alt="code-12">
                <p>
                    You can declare your own types that use generics:
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-13.png" alt="code-13">

                <h2>Structural Type System</h2>
                <p>
                    One of TypeScript's core principles is that type checking focuses on the <i>shape</i> that values have. This is 
                    sometimes called “duck typing” or “structural typing”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a structural type system, if two objects have the same shape, they are considered to be of the same type.
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-14.png" alt="code-14">
                <p>
                    The <b>point</b> variable is never declared to be a <b>Point</b> type. However, TypeScript compares the shape of 
                    <b>point</b> to the shape of <b>Point</b> in the type-check. They have the same shape, so the code passes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shape-matching only requires a subset of the object’s fields to match.
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-15.png" alt="code-15">
                <p>
                    There is no difference between how classes and objects conform to shapes:
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/js-16.png" alt="code-16">
                <p>
                    If the object or class has all the required properties, TypeScript will say they match, regardless of the implementation details.
