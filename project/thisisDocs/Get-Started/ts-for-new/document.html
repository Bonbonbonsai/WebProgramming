                <h1>TypeScript for the New Programmer</h1>
                <p>
                    Congratulations on choosing TypeScript as one of your first languages — you're already making good
                    decisions!<br><br>
                    You've probably already heard that TypeScript is a “flavor” or “variant” of JavaScript. The
                    relationship
                    between TypeScript (TS) and JavaScript (JS) is rather unique among modern programming languages, so
                    learning
                    more about this relationship will help you understand how TypeScript adds to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>What is JavaScript? A Brief History</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript (also known as ECMAScript) started its life as a simple scripting language for browsers.
                    At the time it was invented,
                    it was expected to be used for short snippets of code embedded in a web page — writing more than a
                    few dozen lines of code would
                    have been somewhat unusual. Due to this, early web browsers executed such code pretty slowly. Over
                    time, though, JS became more and
                    more popular, and web developers started using it to create interactive experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Web browser developers responded to this increased JS usage by optimizing their execution engines
                    (dynamic compilation) and extending
                    what could be done with it (adding APIs), which in turn made web developers use it even more. On
                    modern websites, your browser is
                    frequently running applications that span hundreds of thousands of lines of code. This is the long
                    and gradual growth of “the web”,
                    starting as a simple network of static pages, and evolving into a platform for rich applications of
                    all kinds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More than this, JS has become popular enough to be used outside the context of browsers, such as
                    implementing JS servers using node.js.
                    The “run anywhere” nature of JS makes it an attractive choice for cross-platform development. There
                    are many developers these days that
                    use only JavaScript to program their entire stack!
                </p>
                <p>
                    To summarize, we have a language that was designed for quick uses, and then grew to a full-fledged
                    tool to write applications with millions
                    of lines. Every language has its own quirks — oddities and surprises, and JavaScript's humble
                    beginning makes it have many of these. Some examples:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>JavaScript's equality operator (<b>==</b>) coerces its operands, leading to unexpected
                            behavior:</p>
                        <img src="../../../img/begin-1.png" alt="if-else-code">
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <p>JavaScript also allows accessing properties which aren't present:</p>
                        <img src="../../../img/begin-2.png" alt="const-code">
                    </li>
                </ul>                <p>
                    Most programming languages would throw an error when these sorts of errors occur, some would do so
                    during compilation
                    — before any code is running. When writing small programs, such quirks are annoying but manageable;
                    when writing applications
                    with hundreds or thousands of lines of code, these constant surprises are a serious problem
                </p>
                <h2>TypeScript: A Static Type Checker</h2>
                <p>
                    We said earlier that some languages wouldn't allow those buggy programs to run at all. Detecting
                    errors in code without running
                    it is referred to as static checking. Determining what's an error and what's not based on the kinds
                    of values being operated on
                    is known as static type checking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TypeScript checks a program for errors before execution, and does so based on the kinds of values,
                    making <i>it a static type checker.</i>
                    For example, the last example above has an error because of the type of obj. Here's the error
                    TypeScript found:
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/begin-3.png" alt="code-3">

                <h3>A Typed Superset of JavaScript</h3>
                <p>How does TypeScript relate to JavaScript, though?</p>

                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                <p>
                    TypeScript is a language that is a superset of JavaScript: JS syntax is therefore legal TS. Syntax
                    refers to the way we write text to form
                    a program. For example, this code has a syntax error because it's missing a <b>)</b> :
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/begin-4.png" alt="code-4">
                <p>
                    TypeScript doesn’t consider any JavaScript code to be an error because of its syntax. This means you
                    can take any working JavaScript
                    code and put it in a TypeScript file without worrying about exactly how it is written.
                </p>

                <h3>Types</h3>
                <p>
                    However, TypeScript is a <i>typed</i> superset, meaning that it adds rules about how different kinds
                    of values can be used.
                    The earlier error about <b>obj.heigth</b> was not a <i>syntax</i> error: it is an error of using
                    some
                    kind of value <i>(a type)</i> in an incorrect way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As another example, this is JavaScript code that you can run in your browser, and it <i>will</i> log
                    a value:
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/begin-5.png" alt="code-5">
                <p>
                    This syntactically-legal program logs <b>Infinity</b>. TypeScript, though, considers division of
                    number by an array
                    to be a nonsensical operation, and will issue an error:
                </p>
                <img src="../../../img/begin-6.png" alt="code-6">
                <p>
                    It's possible you really did intend to divide a number by an array, perhaps just to see what
                    happens, but most of the time,
                    though, this is a programming mistake. TypeScript's type checker is designed to allow correct
                    programs through while still
                    catching as many common errors as possible. (Later, we'll learn about settings you can use to
                    configure how strictly
                    TypeScript checks your code.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you move some code from a JavaScript file to a TypeScript file, you might see type <i>errors</i>
                    depending on how the code is written.
                    These may be legitimate problems with the code, or TypeScript being overly conservative. Throughout
                    this guide we'll demonstrate
                    how to add various TypeScript syntax to eliminate such errors.
                </p>

                <h3>Runtime Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    TypeScript is also a programming language that preserves the <i>runtime behavior</i> of JavaScript.
                    For example, dividing by zero in JavaScript
                    produces <b>Infinity</b> instead of throwing a runtime exception. As a principle, TypeScript never
                    changes the runtime behavior of JavaScript code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This means that if you move code from JavaScript to TypeScript, it is guaranteed to run the same
                    way, even if TypeScript thinks that
                    the code has type errors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keeping the same runtime behavior as JavaScript is a foundational promise of TypeScript because it
                    means you can easily transition between the
                    two languages without worrying about subtle differences that might make your program stop working.
                </p>

                <h3>Erased Types</h3>
                <p>
                    Roughly speaking, once TypeScript's compiler is done with checking your code, it <i>erases</i> the
                    types to produce the resulting “compiled” code.
                    This means that once your code is compiled, the resulting plain JS code has no type information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This also means that TypeScript never changes the behavior of your program based on the types it
                    inferred. The bottom line is that while you might see
                    type errors during compilation, the type system itself has no bearing on how your program works when
                    it runs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, TypeScript doesn't provide any additional runtime libraries. Your programs will use the
                    same standard library (or external libraries)
                    as JavaScript programs, so there's no additional TypeScript-specific framework to learn.
                </p>

                <h2>Learning JavaScript and TypeScript</h2>
                <p>
                    We frequently see the question “Should I learn JavaScript or TypeScript?“.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The answer is that you can't learn TypeScript without learning JavaScript! TypeScript shares syntax
                    and runtime behavior with JavaScript,
                    so anything you learn about JavaScript is helping you learn TypeScript at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many, many resources available for programmers to learn JavaScript; you should not ignore
                    these resources if you're writing TypeScript. For example,
                    there are about 20 times more StackOverflow questions tagged <b>javascript</b> than
                    <b>typescript</b>, but all of the <b>javascript</b> questions also apply to TypeScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you find yourself searching for something like “how to sort a list in TypeScript”, remember:
                    <b>TypeScript is JavaScript's runtime with a compile-time type checker</b>. The way
                    you sort a list in TypeScript is the same way you do so in JavaScript. If you find a resource that
                    uses TypeScript directly, that's great too,
                    but don't limit yourself to thinking you need TypeScript-specific answers for everyday questions
                    about how to accomplish runtime tasks.
